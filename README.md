TedivmStashBundle
=================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tedivm/TedivmStashBundle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tedivm/TedivmStashBundle)

The **TedivmStashBundle** integrates the [Stash caching library](https://github.com/tedivm/Stash) into Symfony, providing a
powerful abstraction for a range of caching engines. This bundle provides a caching service, adds Stash information to
the Web Profiler toolbar, and adds integration for the Doctrine Common Cache library.

Both the bundle and Stash are licensed under the New BSD License.

## Installation ##

Add the bundle using composer, either by requiring it on the command line:

    composer require tedivm/stash-bundle

or by adding it directly to your `composer.json` file:

    "require": {
        "tedivm/stash-bundle": "dev-master"
    }

Add the bundle to `app/AppKernel.php`:

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        return array(
            new Tedivm\StashBundle\TedivmStashBundle(),
        );
    }

And then set the basic configuration in `app/config/config.yml`:

`tedivm_stash:Â ~`

## Usage ##

Just fetch the default cache pool service:

`$pool = $this->container->get('cache');`

Or a custom-defined cache pool:

`$pool = $this->container->get('stash.custom_cache');`

Then you can use the cache service directly:

    $item = $pool->getItem($id, 'info');

    $info = $item->get();

    if($item->isMiss())
    {
        $info = loadInfo($id);
        $item->store($userInfo);
    }

    return $info;

(See the [Stash documentation](http://stash.tedivm.com/) for more information on using the cache service.)

## Configuration ##

### Default Cache Service ###

To get started quickly, you can define a single caching service with a single driver:

    tedivm_stash:
        cache:
            handlers: [ FileSystem]
            FileSystem: ~

This cache service will be registered as `stash.default_cache`, which will also be automatically aliased to `cache`.

### Configuring Drivers ###

You can set the individual parameters of the cache driver directly in the configuration:

    tedivm_stash:
        cache:
            handlers: [ FileSystem ]
            FileSystem:
                dirSplit: 3
                path: /tmp

### Multiple Drivers ###

If you want to use multiple drivers in sequence, you can list them separately:

    tedivm_stash:
        cache:
            handlers: [ Apc, FileSystem ]
            Apc: ~
            FileSystem:
                path: /tmp

The cache service will automatically be configured with a Composite handler, with the drivers queried in the specified
order (for example, in this example, Apc would be queried first, followed by FileSystem if that query failed.)

### In-Memory ###

By default, every cache service includes in-memory caching: during the lifetime of a single request, any values stored
or retrieved from the cache service will be stored in memory, with the in-memory representation being checked before
any other drivers. In some circumstances, however (such as long-running CLI batch scripts) this may not be desirable.
In those cases, the in-memory handler can be disabled:

    tedivm_stash:
        cache:
            handlers: [ Apc ]
            inMemory: false
            Apc: ~

### Doctrine Adapter ###

Stash provides a Doctrine cache adapter so that your Stash caching service can be injected into any service that takes
a DoctrineCacheInterface object. To turn on the adapter for a service, set the parameter:

    tedivm_stash:
        cache:
            handlers: [ Apc ]
            registerDoctrineAdapter: true
            Apc: ~

For the default cache, the Adapter service will be added to the container under the name
`stash.adapter.doctrine.default_cache`. You can use it anywhere you'd use a regular Doctrine Cache object:

    doctrine:
        orm:
            metadata_cache_driver:
                type: service
                id: stash.adapter.doctrine.default_cache
            query_cache_driver:
                type: service
                id: stash.adapter.doctrine.default_cache
            result_cache_driver:
                type: service
                id: stash.adapter.doctrine.default_cache

### Multiple Services ###

You can also configure multiple services, each of which stores is entirely separate:

    tedivm_stash:
        caches:
            first:
                handlers: [ FileSystem ]
                registerDoctrineAdapter: true
                FileSystem: ~
            second:
                handlers: [ Apc, FileSystem ]
                inMemory: false
                FileSystem ~

Each service is defined with keys inside a separate, distinct internal namespace, so you can use multiple services to
avoid key collisions between distinct services even if you only have a single backend available.

When multiple caches are defined, you can manually define a default, which will be aliased to the `stash` service:

    tedivm_stash:
        default_cache: first
        first:
            ...
        second:
            ...

If you don't, the first service defined will be set as the default.

### Logging ###

StashBundle includes a module which logs the keys of all cache queries made during a request for debugging purposes. By
default this module is enabled in the `dev` and `test` environments but disabled elsewhere. However, if you want to
override the default behavior, you can enable or disable this behavior in the configuration:

    tedivm_stash:
        logging: true # enables query logging, false to disable

## Stash Driver Configuration ##

Each driver comes with a set of default options which canb be individually overrided.

    FileSystem:
        dirSplit:               2
        path:                   %kernel.cache_dir%/stash
        filePermissions:        0660
        dirPermissions:         0770
        memKeyLimit:            20
    Sqlite:
        path:                   %kernel.cache_dir%/stash
        filePermissions:        0660
        dirPermissions:         0770
        busyTimeout:            500
        nesting:                0
        subdriver:              PDO
    Apc:
        ttl:                    300
        namespace:              <none>
    Memcache:
        servers:
            - { server: 127.0.0.1, port: 11211, weight: 1 }
